# cubr is the main class for the solver, including subclasses responsible for:
#   -computer vision on Rubik's cube
#   -solving algorithm for producing solution sequence
#   -motor control
#
# The cubr class itself should provide all of the API for the GUI, such as all
# the button bindings (solve etc), video stream provision and
# calibration/configuration API.

# This will also be the de-facto point for handling exceptions

# Theoretically, these logical units can be easily adapted/replaced to suit
# future iterations of the solvers.
